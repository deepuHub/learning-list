      content: "Welcome to Machine Learning! This week, we introduce the core idea of teaching a computer to learn concepts using data—without being explicitly programmed. We are going to start by covering linear regression with one variable. Linear regression predicts a real-valued output based on an input value. We discuss the application of linear regression to housing price prediction, present the notion of a cost function, and introduce the gradient descent method for learning. We’ll also have optional lessons that provide a refresher on linear algebra concepts. Basic understanding of linear algebra is necessary for the rest of the course, especially as we begin to cover models with multiple variables. Supervised Learning, Unsupervised Learning, Model Representation, Cost Function, Gradient Descent."

      content: "Welcome to week 2! I hope everyone has been enjoying the course and learning a lot! This week we’re covering linear regression with multiple variables. we’ll show how linear regression can be extended to accommodate multiple input features. We also discuss best practices for implementing linear regression. We’re also going to go over how to use Octave. You’ll work on programming assignments designed to help you understand how to implement the learning algorithms in practice. To complete the programming assignments, you will need to use Octave or MATLAB. MatLab, Linear Regression, Multi variate Regression, Feature normalization, Normal equations."

      content: "Welcome to week 3! This week, we’ll be covering logistic regression. Logistic regression is a method for classifying data into discrete outcomes. For example, we might use logistic regression to classify an email as spam or not spam. In this module, we introduce the notion of classification, the cost function for logistic regression, and the application of logistic regression to multi-class classification. We are also covering regularization. Machine learning models need to generalize well to new examples that the model has not seen in practice. We’ll introduce regularization, which helps prevent models from overfitting the training data. Logistic Regression, Classiﬁcation,Decision	boundary Overfitting, Advanced Optmization, Multi‐class classiﬁcation, Underfitting, Regularization, Regularized logistic regression, Advanced optimization. Assignments - 1. you will build a logistic regression model to predict whether a student gets admitted into a university 2. you will implement regularized logistic regression to predict whether microchips from a fabrication plant passes quality assurance (QA)."

      content: "Welcome to week 4! This week, we are covering neural networks. Neural networks is a model inspired by how the brain works. It is widely used today in many applications: when your phone interprets and understand your voice commands, it is likely that a neural network is helping to understand your speech; when you cash a check, the machines that automatically read the digits also use neural networks. In this exercise, you will implement one-vs-all logistic regression and neural networks to recognize hand-written digits."
    - page: "5"
      content: "In Week 5, you will be learning how to train Neural Networks. The Neural Network is one of the most powerful learning algorithms (when a linear classifier doesn't work, this is what I usually turn to), and this week's videos explain the 'backpropagation' algorithm for training these models. In this week's programming assignment, you'll also get to implement this algorithm and see it work for yourself. The Neural Network programming exercise will be one of the more challenging ones of this class. Cost function, Backpropagation algorithm, Implementationm note:Unrolling parameters, Gradient Checking, Random Initialization, eg: Autonomous driving."

Machine learning tends to work well when you're trying to learn a simple concept, such as something that you could do with less than a second of mental thought, and when there's lots of data available. Machine learning tends to work poorly when you're trying to learn a complex concept from small amounts of data. A second underappreciated weakness of AI is that it tends to do poorly when it's asked to perform on new types of data that's different than the data it has seen in your data set."

    - page: "2" 
      content: "So, data science projects have a different workflow than machine learning projects."
    - page: "2" 
      content: "The first step is to collect data."
    - page: "2" 
      content: "So the key steps of a data science project are to collect the data, to analyze the data, and then to suggest hypotheses and actions, and then to continue to get the data back and reanalyze the data periodically."

    - page: "2" 
      content: "In this video, you see a framework for brainstorming potentially exciting AI projects to pursue."
    - page: "2" 
      content: "What you would like to do is try to select projects that are at the intersection of these two sets, so you select projects hopefully that are both feasible, that can be done with AI, and that are also valuable for your business."
    - page: "2" 
      content: "So when brainstorming projects that AI can do and are valuable for your business, I will often bring together a team comprising both people knowledgeable of AI, as well as experts in your business area to brainstorm together."
    - page: "2" 
      content: "So sometimes we also call these cross-functional teams, and that just means a team that includes both AI experts, as well as domain experts, meaning experts in your area of business."
    - page: "2" 
      content: "When brainstorming projects, there's a framework that I've used with a lot of companies that I found to be useful."
    - page: "2" 
      content: "So let me share with you three principles or three ideas for how you can have a team brainstorm projects."
    - page: "2" 
      content: "First, even though there's been a lot of press coverage about AI automating jobs away, and this is an important societal issue that needs to addressed, when thinking about concrete AI projects, I find it much more useful to think about automating tasks rather than automating jobs."
    - page: "2" 
      content: "When I'm meeting CEOs of large companies to brainstorm AI projects for the company, a common question I'll also ask is, what are the main drivers of business value? And sometimes finding AI solutions or data science solutions to augment this can be very valuable."
    - page: "2" 
      content: "Finally, a third question that I've asked that sometimes let to valuable project ideas is, what are the main pain points in your business? Some of them could be solved with AI, some of them can't be solved with AI."
    - page: "2" 
      content: "I have one last piece of advice for brainstorming AI projects, which is that you can make progress even without big data, even without tons of data."
    - page: "2" 
      content: "Now don't get me wrong, having more data almost never hurts, other than maybe needing to pay a bit more for disk space or network bandwidth to transmit and store the data, having more data almost always is only helpful."
    - page: "2" 
      content: "But my advice is, don't give up just because you don't have a lot of data to start off with."
    - page: "2" 
      content: "And you can often still make progress, even with a small dataset."
    - page: "2" 
      content: "In this video, I want to step you through the process that I use to double-check if a project is worth that many months of effort. Let's take a look."
    - page: "2" 
      content: "So, to make sure a project is feasible, I will usually go through technical diligence, and make sure that the project is valuable, I will usually go through a business diligence process."
    - page: "2" 
      content: "Technical diligence is the process of making sure that the AI system you hope to build really is doable, really is feasible."
    - page: "2" 
      content: "So, you might talk to AI experts about whether or not the AI system can actually meet the desired level of performance."
    - page: "2" 
      content: "Again, is this actually doable with today's technology? A second important question for technical diligence is how much data is needed to get to this desired level of performance, and do you have a way to get that much data."
    - page: "2" 
      content: "Third, would be engineering timeline to try to figure out how long it will take and how many people it will take to build a system that you would like to have built."
    - page: "2" 
      content: "In addition to technical diligence, I will often also conduct business diligence to make sure that the project you envision really is valuable for the business."
    - page: "2" 
      content: "So, a lot of AI projects will drive value through lowering costs."
    - page: "2" 
      content: "For example, by automating a few tasks or by squeezing more efficiency onto the system."
    - page: "2" 
      content: "A lot of AI systems can also increase revenue."
    - page: "2" 
      content: "For example, driving more people to check out in your shopping cart or you may be building an AI system to help you launch a new product or a new line of business."
    - page: "2" 
      content: "So, business diligence is the process of thinking through carefully for the AI system that you're building such as a speech recognition system that's 95 percent accurate or a visual inspection system that's 99.9 percent accurate, would allow you to achieve your business goals."
    - page: "2" 
      content: "When conducting business diligence, I'll often end up building spreadsheet financial models to estimate the value quantitatively such as estimate how many dollars are actually saved or what do we think is a reasonable assumption in terms of entries revenue, and to model out the economics associated ..."
    - page: "2" 
      content: "So, in addition to technical diligence and business diligence, I hope you also conduct ethical diligence and make sure that whatever you're doing is actually making humanity and making society better off."
    - page: "2" 
      content: "As you're planning out your AI project, you also have to decide do you want to build or buy? This is an age old question in the IT world and we're facing this question in AI as well."
    - page: "2" 
      content: "Unlike machine learning projects though, data science projects are more commonly done in-house."
    - page: "2" 
      content: "They're not impossible to outsource, you can sometimes outsource them, but what I've seen is that data science projects are often so closely tied to your business that it takes very deep day-to-day knowledge about your business to do the best data science projects."
    - page: "2" 
      content: "Finally, in every industry some things will be industry standard and you should avoid building those."
    - page: "2" 
      content: "A common answer to the build versus buy question was, build the things that are going to be quite specialized to you or completely specialized to you or they'll allow you to build a unique defensible advantage, but the things that will be industry standard probably some other company will build and ..."

      content: "First, it really helps your AI team if you can specify an acceptance criteria for the project."
    - page: "2"

    - page: "2" 
      content: "So, I will urge you to discuss with your AI engineers what is a reasonable level of accuracy to try to accomplish? Then try to find something that passes both technical diligence as well as business diligence without necessarily needing a 100% accuracy."

But what I hope to do this week is help you paint a vision for where an organization can go over a longer period of time like that. But also end the week with very concrete short steps you can take right away. You also learn what are the major roles in an AI team. So if ever you think your company can build a large AI team with maybe many dozens or maybe even hundreds of people, what are the things these people will do? We'll start to paint a roadmap for what building an AI team might look like. Third you also learn about the AI transformation playbook of how to help your company become good at AI.

      content: "The speaker uses a machine learning algorithm to input the audio clip and output. Let's get started. Smart speakers and voice activated devices like these are taking the world by storm and if you don't already have one in your home, maybe you buy one someday. Just for the record, my favorite joke is why are there so me shocking results in AI, because AI is the new electricity, shocking electricity, get it? Hope you enjoyed that. So, all right, and in seriousness, you can think of the four steps of the algorithm as these four steps, where the first step is trigger word detection, second step, speech recognition, then intent recognition, and then finally, execution of what are the command the user asked the smart speaker to execute."

      content: "These are the key steps for deciding how to drive your self-driving car. The car will take as input various sensors such as pictures of what's in front of the car or to the sides or behind, as well as maybe radar or Lidar meaning laser sensor readings. Given these inputs of a picture and maybe other things, it then has to detect other cars. So given that, hopefully, you'll figure out there's a car there, as well as where are the pedestrians, because we want to avoid other cars as well as avoid pedestrians. Both car detection and pedestrian detection can be done with machine learning using input/ output or A to B mappings that takes as input the picture and maybe radar and Lidar, sends the inputs and tells us where are the other cars and pedestrians. Finally, now that you know where are the other cars and where are the pedestrians, you can then feed this information into another specialized piece of software, it's called a motion planning piece of software that plans the motion or plans the path that you want your car to take, so that you can make progress to your destination while avoiding any collisions. Once you've planned out the motion for your car, you can then translate that into specific steering angle for your steering wheel and acceleration and brake commands, so how much to step on the gas pedal, and how much to brake in order to get your car to move at the desired angle as well as speed."
    - page: "3" 
      content: "Many AI teams will have Software Engineers in them. So, for example, for the smart speaker we needed to write specialized software to execute on the joke or to set a timer or to answer questions about today's weather. So, those are traditional software engineering tasks. Or you're building a self-driving car to make sure that your self-driving car software is reliable and doesn't crash. These are software engineering tasks. So, it's not uncommon for AI teams to have enlarged fractions sometimes ..."
    - page: "3" 
      content: "The second common role is the Machine Learning Engineer. So, Machine Learning Engineer might write the software responsible for generating the A to B mapping or for building other machine learning algorithms needed for your product. So, they might gather the data of pictures of cars and positions of cars, train a neural network or train a deep learning algorithm and work iteratively to make sure that the learning algorithm is giving accurate outputs."
    - page: "3" 
      content: "Another role that you sometimes hear about is the Machine Learning Researcher. The typical row of the Machine Learning Researcher is to extend the state of the art in machine learning. Machine learning and AI more broadly are still advancing rapidly. So, many companies for profit and non-profit, more have Machine Learning Researchers responsible for extending the state-of-the-art. Some Machine Learning Researchers will publish papers, but many companies also have Machine Learning Researchers tha..."

      content: "There's one other job title that's sort of in-between these two which is the Applied Machine Learning Scientists, which live somewhere between Machine Learning Engineer and Machine Learning Researcher. The Machine Learning Scientists kind of does a bit of both. They are often responsible for going to the academic literature or the research literature and finding the steady VR techniques and finding ways to adapt them to the problem they are facing such as how to take the most cutting edge, trigg..."
    - page: "3" 
      content: "Today, there are a lot of Data Scientists working in industries. The role of Data Scientist is not very well defined and the meaning is still evolving today. I think one of the primary responsibilities of Data Scientists is to examine data and provide insights, as well as to make presentations to teams or the executives in order to help drive business decision-making. There also Data Scientists today doing other tasks. So, there are also Data Scientists today whose work looks more like the Machi..."

      content: "With the rise of big data, there are also more and more Data Engineers whose main role is to help you organize your data, meaning, to make sure that your data is saved and is easily accessible, secure and cost-effective way."
    - page: "3" 
      content: "Finally, you'll also hear some people referred to AI Product Managers whose job is to help decide what to build. In other words, they help to figure out what's feasible and valuable. Traditional Product Manager's job was already to decide what to build as well as sometimes some other roles, but the AI Product Manager now has to do this in the AI era and they're needing new skill sets to figure out what's feasible and valuable in light of what AI can and cannot do today."
    - page: "3" 
      content: "So, whether you just have one Software Engineer working with you, or just a single Machine Learning Engineer, or just a single Data Scientists, or maybe nobody, but yourself, if either you or an engineer working with you has taken some online courses on machine learning or deep learning or data science, that's often enough for you by yourself or for you and an engineer to start looking at some smaller volumes of data, start drawing some conclusions or start trading some machine learning models ..."
    - page: "3" 
      content: "rading some machine learning models to get going. So, even though I've tried to paint here a vision for what a large AI team might look like, even if you have only a small AI team, could be nobody by yourself, I would still encourage you to get started and start exploring what the projects you could do."
    - page: "3" 
      content: "I've spent a lot of time thinking about what it takes to help a great company become a great AI company and I wound up writing an AI transformation playbook to help other countries on this journey"
    - page: "3" 
      content: "Let's get started. Here are the five steps of the AI transformation playbook. We'll dive into greater detail in a little bit but briefly, step one is for your company to execute pilot projects to gain momentum. Start to know what it feels like to work on AI projects."
    - page: "3" 
      content: "Step two, is to build an in-house AI team. Step three, is to provide broad AI training, not just the engineers but to many levels within a company including executives. Step four, is to develop your AI strategy and step five, is to develop internal and external communications about your company and AI."
    - page: "3" 
      content: "Finally, your first one or two pilot projects can be either in-house or outsource. If you do not yet have a large in-house AI team, might be possible, might even be advisable to outsource some or all of your first couple of AI projects in order to get more expertise in house and to let you start building that momentum faster. Now, beyond a certain point, you will need your own in-house AI team to execute a long-term sequence of maybe many dozens of AI projects."
    - page: "3" 
      content: "A lot of companies are organized like this, where, there's a CEO and multiple business units which I'm going to abbreviate with BU that reports up to the CEO. So, what I recommend for most companies is to build a centralized AI team and then to take the talent in the matrix organization and two matrix them into these different business units to support their work."
    - page: "3" 
      content: "One other responsibility for the AI unit, is to build a company wide platforms. If there are software platforms or other tools or data infrastructure that could be useful for the whole company, then a single business unit may not have the resources or the incentive to build these company-wide platforms and resources that can support the whole company but essentialized AI team maybe help built these company wide tools or platforms that can help multiple business units."
    - page: "3" 
      content: "Finally, this new AI business unit can be under the CTO, the CIO, the chief data officer or the Chief Digital Officer or it could also be under a new chief AI officer. The CAIO chief AI officer is a role that I'm seeing more and more often in different companies but if some other senior executive has the right skill set, they could also manage the AI unit."
    - page: "3" 
      content: "Finally, one last recommendation, which is that, I think it is hopeful if to get the AI units started the company or the CEO provides funding to build at the AI unit rather than required AI unit to get funding from the business units. Eventually, after the initial investment and after the initial ramp up, the AI unit will have to show his value that is creating for the business units but having CEO inject funding at the outset so they can get going, will often help you get that initial momentum ..."
    - page: "3" 
      content: "that initial momentum much faster. In addition to building an in-house AI team, I also recommend that you provide broad AI training. Now, for accompany that become good at AI, is not just that you need engineers to know AI, you need multiple people at multiple levels of the company to understand how AI interacts with their roles."
    - page: "3" 
      content: "In the last video, you learned how to execute pilot projects to gain momentum for the in-house AI team and provide broad AI training."
    - page: "3" 
      content: "Let's talk about AI strategy as well as perhaps important for some companies, internal and external communications relative to AI"
    - page: "3" 
      content: "To recap, this is the five-step AI transformation playbook, and in this video, we'll dive more deeply into these final two steps. Step four of the AI transmission playbook is to develop an AI strategy, which, I hope for you may mean to leverage AI to create an advantage specific to your industry sector."
    - page: "3" 
      content: "One unusual part of this playbook is that developing the AI strategy is step four not step one. When I shared this with many CEOs consistent request of please feedback ago was, can you please put the strategy as step one? Because I want to figure out what is my company strategy, then I want to find the resources, and then execute on the strategy."
    - page: "3" 
      content: "But I've found that companies that tried to define the strategy as step one, before getting your feet wet, before trying out AI knowing what a feasibility AI project. Companies like that tend to end up with sometimes very academic strategies that are sometimes not true to life."
    - page: "3" 
      content: "So, for example, I've seen some CEOs copy and paste newspaper headlines into this strategy. We read that data is important, he say, My strategy is to focus on collecting a lot of data, but for your company, that data may or may not be valuable, and may or may not be a good strategy for your company. So, I tend to recommend to companies to start the other steps first, execute the pilot projects. Start building a little bit of a team. Start providing some training, so that only after you understa..."

      content: "One of the reasons that web search is a very defensible business, meaning is very difficult for new entrants to compete with the incumbents with the existing large web search engines, is this: If a company has a better product, maybe a slightly better product, then that web search engine can acquire more users. Having more users means that you collect more data because you get to observe what different users click on when they search for different terms, and that data can be fed into an AI engi..."
    - page: "3" 
      content: "It makes it very difficult for a new entrant to break into this self-reinforcing positive feedback loop, called the virtuous cycle of AI. Fortunately though, this virtuous cycle of AI can be used by smaller teams entering new verticals as well."
    - page: "3" 
      content: "Let me illustrate with an example. There is a company called Blue River that was acquired by John Deere for over US$300 million, and Blue River makes agricultural technology using AI. So, what they did was build these machines that would be towed behind a tractor, in a big agricultural fields. This machine would take pictures of crops and figure out which is a crop and which is a weed, and use precision AI to kill off just the weeds, but not the crop. So, I knew some of the founders of Blue Rive..."
    - page: "3" 
      content: "Other elements of an AI strategy. We are going to live in an AI power world and the right strategy can help your company navigate these changes much more effectively. You should also consider creating a data strategy. Leading AI companies are very good at strategic data acquisition."
    - page: "3" 
      content: "You might also consider building a unified data warehouse. If you have 50 different data warehouses under the control of 50 different vice presidents, then is almost impossible for an AI engineer or for a piece of AI software to pull together all of this data in order to connect the dots."
    - page: "3" 
      content: "This is a very powerful thing that you can do to build a great AI company, and so I hope that whatever you do, you do this only in ways that make humanity better off."
    - page: "3" 
      content: "The final step of the AI transmission playbook is to develop internal and external communications. AI can change a company and its products, and its important to communicate appropriately with the relevant stakeholders about this. For example, this may include investor relations to make sure that your investors can value your company appropriately as an AI company. Investor relations may also includes government relations."
    - page: "3" 
      content: "have also seen many common pitfalls, the companies run into when trying to implement AI across the enterprise. Let's take a look at some of these common pitfalls in the next video so that hopefully, you can avoid them."

      content: "Let's go over a five don'ts and dos for if you're trying to build AI for your company."
    - page: "3" 
      content: "First one, don't expect AI to solve everything."
    - page: "3" 
      content: "Instead, you should be realistic about what AI can or cannot do, given the limitations of technology, data, and engineering resources."
    - page: "3" 
      content: "That's why I think technical diligence in addition to business diligence is important for selecting feasible and valuable AI projects."
    - page: "3" 
      content: "Second, don't just hire two or three machine learning engineers and count solely on them to come up with use cases for your company."
    - page: "3" 
      content: "Machine learning engineers are a scarce resource but you should instead air the engineer talents with business talent and work cross-functionally to find feasible and valuable projects."
    - page: "3" 
      content: "Is often the combination of the machine-learning talents worked to business talent that can select the most valuable and feasible projects."

      content: "Third, don't expect AI project to work the first time."
    - page: "3" 
      content: "As you've already seen, AI development is often an iterative process so should plan for it through an iterative process with multiple attempts needed to succeed."
    - page: "3" 
      content: "Fourth, don't expect traditional planning processes to apply without changes."
    - page: "3" 
      content: "Instead, you should work with the AI team to establish timeline estimates, milestones, KPIs or metrics that do make sense."
    - page: "3" 
      content: "Finally, don't think you need superstar AI engineers before you can do anything."
    - page: "3" 
      content: "In the final video for this week, I want to share with you some concrete first steps you can take in AI."
    - page: "3" 
      content: "This week, you saw some examples of what it's like to build a complex AI product, like a smart speaker, or self-driving car. You also learned about the roles and responsibilities of large AI teams, and maybe what it's like to build a large AI team, and saw the AI transformation playbook for helping a great company become a great AI company."
    - page: "3" 
      content: "So, in this video, I want to share with you some concrete suggestions for the next step you can take toward AI for yourself or for your company."

    - page: "3" 
      content: "I think the key question to ask your CEO or your Board is, will your company be much more valuable and/or much more effective if it was great at AI."
    - page: "3" 
      content: "So, if you've ever wondered, what do the terms Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing mean? Or, what is Reinforcement Learning? Or, what is Unsupervised Learning? Please take a look at these videos, since we'll teach you these application areas, as well as technologies in the next two videos. We made these videos optional because they are a little bit more technical, but after watching them, you will be able to better communicate with AI engineers."
    - page: "4" 
      content: "AI is a superpower that enables a small team to affect a huge number of people's lives. So, whether you're builder or user of AI or whether you're just somebody cares about AI's impact on society, is important that you learn about these trends, so that you can make sure the work you do leave society better off."
    - page: "4" 
      content: "AI has other limitations as well. For example, AI can be biased and discriminate unfairly against minorities or against other groups. So, how do we address this? AI technology is also susceptible to adversarial attacks, meaning for example, we love our spam filters, it helps the email system keep on functioning. But there are spammers that are trying to attack spam filters. Even as we develop new AI technologies, some of the new technologies may be susceptible to new types of attacks as well if ..."
    - page: "4" 
      content: "Developed economies such as the US and China, are already using AI extensively, but they'll also have a big impact on developing economies and on the global jobs landscape. Many of these issues are implicated in AI and ethics. To make sure that the work we do in AI is ethical. This is a topic that is complex and there aren't simple answers. In fact, I think the topic of AI and ethics deserves it's own four week or much longer course."
    - page: "4" 
      content: "So, for all of us to make good decisions, it is important that we have a realistic view of AI and be neither too optimistic nor too pessimistic."
    - page: "4" 
      content: "I think we need a similar Goldilocks rule for AI, where I think it's important that we be neither too optimistic nor too pessimistic about what AI technology can or cannot do."
    - page: "4" 
      content: "The extreme pessimist view of AI, is that AI cannot do everything. There are some things AI cannot do and so, another AI winter is coming. The term AI winter refers to a couple of episodes in history when AI had been over-hyped and when people figured out that AI couldn't do everything that they thought it would. It resulted in a loss of faith and a decrease in investment in AI."
    - page: "4" 
      content: "One difference between AI now and the earlier winters of a few decades ago, is that AI today is creating tremendous economic value. We also see a surprisingly clear path for it to continue to create even more value in multiple industries. So, the combination of these two things ensures that AI will continue to grow for the foreseeable future."
    - page: "4" 
      content: "But AI has other limitations, as well. One of the limitations of AI is that explainability is hard and many high-performing AI systems are black boxes. Meaning that it works very well but the AI doesn't know how to explain why it does what it does."
    - page: "4" 
      content: "Now, to be fair, humans are also not very good at explaining how we make decisions ourselves."
    - page: "4" 
      content: "But because AI is a relatively new thing, the lack of explainability is sometimes a barrier to its acceptance. Also, sometimes if an AI system isn't working then its ability to explain itself would also help us figure out how to go in and make the AI system work better. So, explainability is one of the major open research areas. A lot of researchers are working on."
    - page: "4" 
      content: "What I see in practice, is that when an AI team wants to deploy something, that AI team must often able to come up with an explanation that is good enough to enable the system to work and be deployed."
    - page: "4" 
      content: "AI has some other serious limitations. As a society, we do not want to discriminate against individuals based on their gender, based on their ethnicity and we want people to be treated fairly. But when AI systems are fed data that doesn't reflect these values, then an AI can become bias or can learn to discriminate against certain people. The AI community is working hard and is making good progress on these issues but we're far from done and there's still a lot of work to do."
    - page: "4" 
      content: "How does an AI system become bias and therefore discriminated against some people? And how do we try to reduce or eliminate this effect in our AI systems? Let's start with example."
    - page: "4" 
      content: "Let's start with example. A group at Microsoft found this remarkable result that when AI learns from text file on the internet, it can learn unhealthy stereotypes. To the credit, they also proposed technical solutions for reducing the amount of bias in this type of AI system."
    - page: "4" 
      content: "How does an AI system learn to become bias like this from data? Let's dive a bit more into the technical details. The way an AI system stores words is using a set of numbers. So, let's say the word man is stored, or we sometimes say represented as the two numbers 1,1. The way an AI system comes up with these numbers is through statistics of how the word man is used on the Internet."
    - page: "4" 
      content: "For example, there's a company that was using AI for hiring, and found that their hiring too discriminated against women. This is clearly unfair, and so this company shut down their tool. Second, there're also some facial recognition systems that seem to work more accurately for light-skinned and dark-skinned individuals."
    - page: "4" 
      content: "Finally, I think it's important that AI systems do not contribute to the toxic effect of reinforcing unhealthy stereotypes. For example, if an-eight-year old girl goes to an image search engine and searches for Chief Executive Officer, if they see only pictures of men or if they see no one that looks like themselves either by gender or ethnicity, we don't want them to be discouraged from pursuing a career that might lead her to someday be a Chief Executive Officer of a large company."
    - page: "4" 
      content: "Simplifying the description a little bit, researchers have found that when an AI system learns a lot of different numbers with which to store words, there are few numbers that correspond to the bias. If you zero out those numbers, just set them to zero, then the bias diminishes significantly. A second solution is to try to use less bias and or more inclusive data. For example, if you are building a face-recognition system, and make sure to include data from multiple ethnicities, and all genders,..."
    - page: "4" 
      content: "our system will be less biased and more inclusive. Second, many AI teams are subjecting their systems to better transparency and or auditing processes, so that we can constantly check what types of bias, if any, these AI systems are exhibiting, so that we can at least recognize the problem if it exists, and then take steps to address it. For example, many face recognition teams are systematically checking how accurate their system is on different subsets of the population to check whether, it is..."
    - page: "4" 
      content: "Having transparent systems as well as systematic auditing processes increases the odds that will at least quickly spot a problem, in case there is one, so that we can fix it. Finally, I think having a diverse workforce will also help reduce bias. If you have a diverse workforce, then the individuals in your workforce are more likely to be able to spot different problems, and maybe they'll help make your data more diverse and more inclusive in the first place."

      content: "Even though modern AI is incredibly powerful, one of the limitations of modern AI technologies especially deep learning is that sometimes it can be fooled."

      content: "One question now sometimes asked is what should you do if you want to work in AI? Recently, a radiologist resident served radiologists near the start of his career. He actually asked me."
    - page: "4" 
      content: "This one other alternative that you could consider though, which is, I said to this radiology resident consider doing work in AI plus radiology because with your knowledge of radiology, if in addition you learned something about AI, you would be better positioned to do work at the intersection of ra..."
