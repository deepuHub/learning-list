      content: "Welcome to Machine Learning! This week, we introduce the core idea of teaching a computer to learn concepts using data—without being explicitly programmed. We are going to start by covering linear regression with one variable. Linear regression predicts a real-valued output based on an input value. We discuss the application of linear regression to housing price prediction, present the notion of a cost function, and introduce the gradient descent method for learning. We’ll also have optional lessons that provide a refresher on linear algebra concepts. Basic understanding of linear algebra is necessary for the rest of the course, especially as we begin to cover models with multiple variables. Supervised Learning, Unsupervised Learning, Model Representation, Cost Function, Gradient Descent."

      content: "Welcome to week 2! I hope everyone has been enjoying the course and learning a lot! This week we’re covering linear regression with multiple variables. we’ll show how linear regression can be extended to accommodate multiple input features. We also discuss best practices for implementing linear regression. We’re also going to go over how to use Octave. You’ll work on programming assignments designed to help you understand how to implement the learning algorithms in practice. To complete the programming assignments, you will need to use Octave or MATLAB. MatLab, Linear Regression, Multi variate Regression, Feature normalization, Normal equations."

      content: "Welcome to week 3! This week, we’ll be covering logistic regression. Logistic regression is a method for classifying data into discrete outcomes. For example, we might use logistic regression to classify an email as spam or not spam. In this module, we introduce the notion of classification, the cost function for logistic regression, and the application of logistic regression to multi-class classification. We are also covering regularization. Machine learning models need to generalize well to new examples that the model has not seen in practice. We’ll introduce regularization, which helps prevent models from overfitting the training data. Logistic Regression, Classiﬁcation,Decision	boundary Overfitting, Advanced Optmization, Multi‐class classiﬁcation, Underfitting, Regularization, Regularized logistic regression, Advanced optimization. Assignments - 1. you will build a logistic regression model to predict whether a student gets admitted into a university 2. you will implement regularized logistic regression to predict whether microchips from a fabrication plant passes quality assurance (QA)."

      content: "Welcome to week 4! This week, we are covering neural networks. Neural networks is a model inspired by how the brain works. It is widely used today in many applications: when your phone interprets and understand your voice commands, it is likely that a neural network is helping to understand your speech; when you cash a check, the machines that automatically read the digits also use neural networks. In this exercise, you will implement one-vs-all logistic regression and neural networks to recognize hand-written digits."
    - page: "5"
      content: "In Week 5, you will be learning how to train Neural Networks. The Neural Network is one of the most powerful learning algorithms (when a linear classifier doesn't work, this is what I usually turn to), and this week's videos explain the 'backpropagation' algorithm for training these models. In this week's programming assignment, you'll also get to implement this algorithm and see it work for yourself. The Neural Network programming exercise will be one of the more challenging ones of this class. Cost function, Backpropagation algorithm, Implementationm note:Unrolling parameters, Gradient Checking, Random Initialization, eg: Autonomous driving."

Machine learning tends to work well when you're trying to learn a simple concept, such as something that you could do with less than a second of mental thought, and when there's lots of data available. Machine learning tends to work poorly when you're trying to learn a complex concept from small amounts of data. A second underappreciated weakness of AI is that it tends to do poorly when it's asked to perform on new types of data that's different than the data it has seen in your data set."

    - page: "2" 
      content: "So, data science projects have a different workflow than machine learning projects."
    - page: "2" 
      content: "The first step is to collect data."
    - page: "2" 
      content: "So the key steps of a data science project are to collect the data, to analyze the data, and then to suggest hypotheses and actions, and then to continue to get the data back and reanalyze the data periodically."

      content: "In this video, you see a framework for brainstorming potentially exciting AI projects to pursue."
    - page: "2" 
      content: "What you would like to do is try to select projects that are at the intersection of these two sets, so you select projects hopefully that are both feasible, that can be done with AI, and that are also valuable for your business."
    - page: "2" 
      content: "So when brainstorming projects that AI can do and are valuable for your business, I will often bring together a team comprising both people knowledgeable of AI, as well as experts in your business area to brainstorm together."
    - page: "2" 
      content: "So sometimes we also call these cross-functional teams, and that just means a team that includes both AI experts, as well as domain experts, meaning experts in your area of business."
    - page: "2" 
      content: "When brainstorming projects, there's a framework that I've used with a lot of companies that I found to be useful."
    - page: "2" 
      content: "So let me share with you three principles or three ideas for how you can have a team brainstorm projects."
    - page: "2" 
      content: "First, even though there's been a lot of press coverage about AI automating jobs away, and this is an important societal issue that needs to addressed, when thinking about concrete AI projects, I find it much more useful to think about automating tasks rather than automating jobs."
    - page: "2" 
      content: "When I'm meeting CEOs of large companies to brainstorm AI projects for the company, a common question I'll also ask is, what are the main drivers of business value? And sometimes finding AI solutions or data science solutions to augment this can be very valuable."
    - page: "2" 
      content: "Finally, a third question that I've asked that sometimes let to valuable project ideas is, what are the main pain points in your business? Some of them could be solved with AI, some of them can't be solved with AI."
    - page: "2" 
      content: "I have one last piece of advice for brainstorming AI projects, which is that you can make progress even without big data, even without tons of data."
    - page: "2" 
      content: "Now don't get me wrong, having more data almost never hurts, other than maybe needing to pay a bit more for disk space or network bandwidth to transmit and store the data, having more data almost always is only helpful."
    - page: "2" 
      content: "But my advice is, don't give up just because you don't have a lot of data to start off with."
    - page: "2" 
      content: "And you can often still make progress, even with a small dataset."
    - page: "2" 
      content: "In this video, I want to step you through the process that I use to double-check if a project is worth that many months of effort. Let's take a look."
    - page: "2" 
      content: "So, to make sure a project is feasible, I will usually go through technical diligence, and make sure that the project is valuable, I will usually go through a business diligence process."
    - page: "2" 
      content: "Technical diligence is the process of making sure that the AI system you hope to build really is doable, really is feasible."
    - page: "2" 
      content: "So, you might talk to AI experts about whether or not the AI system can actually meet the desired level of performance."
    - page: "2" 
      content: "Again, is this actually doable with today's technology? A second important question for technical diligence is how much data is needed to get to this desired level of performance, and do you have a way to get that much data."
    - page: "2" 
      content: "Third, would be engineering timeline to try to figure out how long it will take and how many people it will take to build a system that you would like to have built."
    - page: "2" 
      content: "In addition to technical diligence, I will often also conduct business diligence to make sure that the project you envision really is valuable for the business."
    - page: "2" 
      content: "So, a lot of AI projects will drive value through lowering costs."
    - page: "2" 
      content: "For example, by automating a few tasks or by squeezing more efficiency onto the system."
    - page: "2" 
      content: "A lot of AI systems can also increase revenue."
    - page: "2" 
      content: "For example, driving more people to check out in your shopping cart or you may be building an AI system to help you launch a new product or a new line of business."
    - page: "2" 
      content: "So, business diligence is the process of thinking through carefully for the AI system that you're building such as a speech recognition system that's 95 percent accurate or a visual inspection system that's 99.9 percent accurate, would allow you to achieve your business goals."
    - page: "2" 
      content: "When conducting business diligence, I'll often end up building spreadsheet financial models to estimate the value quantitatively such as estimate how many dollars are actually saved or what do we think is a reasonable assumption in terms of entries revenue, and to model out the economics associated ..."
    - page: "2" 
      content: "So, in addition to technical diligence and business diligence, I hope you also conduct ethical diligence and make sure that whatever you're doing is actually making humanity and making society better off."
    - page: "2" 
      content: "As you're planning out your AI project, you also have to decide do you want to build or buy? This is an age old question in the IT world and we're facing this question in AI as well."
    - page: "2" 
      content: "Unlike machine learning projects though, data science projects are more commonly done in-house."
    - page: "2" 
      content: "They're not impossible to outsource, you can sometimes outsource them, but what I've seen is that data science projects are often so closely tied to your business that it takes very deep day-to-day knowledge about your business to do the best data science projects."
    - page: "2" 
      content: "Finally, in every industry some things will be industry standard and you should avoid building those."
    - page: "2" 
      content: "A common answer to the build versus buy question was, build the things that are going to be quite specialized to you or completely specialized to you or they'll allow you to build a unique defensible advantage, but the things that will be industry standard probably some other company will build and ..."
    - page: "2"

      content: "Say you found an exciting project that you want to try to execute on, how do you work with an AI team on this project? In this video, you learn how AI teams think about data and therefore how you can interact with AI teams to help them succeed on a project."

      content: "First, it really helps your AI team if you can specify an acceptance criteria for the project."
    - page: "2" 
      content: "So, when specifying your acceptance criteria think of whether your acceptance criteria needs to be specified in a statistical way where you specify on average hour does or what percent of time it has to get the right answer."

    - page: "2" 
      content: "So, I will urge you to discuss with your AI engineers what is a reasonable level of accuracy to try to accomplish? Then try to find something that passes both technical diligence as well as business diligence without necessarily needing a 100% accuracy."
