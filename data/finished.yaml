      content: "Welcome to Machine Learning! This week, we introduce the core idea of teaching a computer to learn concepts using data—without being explicitly programmed. We are going to start by covering linear regression with one variable. Linear regression predicts a real-valued output based on an input value. We discuss the application of linear regression to housing price prediction, present the notion of a cost function, and introduce the gradient descent method for learning. We’ll also have optional lessons that provide a refresher on linear algebra concepts. Basic understanding of linear algebra is necessary for the rest of the course, especially as we begin to cover models with multiple variables. Supervised Learning, Unsupervised Learning, Model Representation, Cost Function, Gradient Descent."

      content: "Welcome to week 2! I hope everyone has been enjoying the course and learning a lot! This week we’re covering linear regression with multiple variables. we’ll show how linear regression can be extended to accommodate multiple input features. We also discuss best practices for implementing linear regression. We’re also going to go over how to use Octave. You’ll work on programming assignments designed to help you understand how to implement the learning algorithms in practice. To complete the programming assignments, you will need to use Octave or MATLAB. MatLab, Linear Regression, Multi variate Regression, Feature normalization, Normal equations."

      content: "Welcome to week 3! This week, we’ll be covering logistic regression. Logistic regression is a method for classifying data into discrete outcomes. For example, we might use logistic regression to classify an email as spam or not spam. In this module, we introduce the notion of classification, the cost function for logistic regression, and the application of logistic regression to multi-class classification. We are also covering regularization. Machine learning models need to generalize well to new examples that the model has not seen in practice. We’ll introduce regularization, which helps prevent models from overfitting the training data. Logistic Regression, Classiﬁcation,Decision	boundary Overfitting, Advanced Optmization, Multi‐class classiﬁcation, Underfitting, Regularization, Regularized logistic regression, Advanced optimization. Assignments - 1. you will build a logistic regression model to predict whether a student gets admitted into a university 2. you will implement regularized logistic regression to predict whether microchips from a fabrication plant passes quality assurance (QA)."
